Your employer must provide you with a Certificate of Sponsorship, which includes information about the role you've been offered.

### 3. Minimum Salary Threshold
Your job must meet the minimum salary requirement:
- General threshold: £26,200 per year or £10.75 per hour

- Can be extended indefinitely
- After 5 years, you may be eligible for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)
